# Data Analysis with Aggregation
# Objective: Write a class `DataAnalyzer` that can load a list of numbers and perform aggregation operations like average, sum, and median.
# Parameters:
# - data: List of numbers.
# Returns:
# - Calculated aggregated values based on the method called.
# Details:
# - Implement methods for `average`, `total`, and `median` which compute respective statistical measures.
# - Ensure the data list is not empty before performing calculations; raise ValueError if it is.

class DataAnalyzer:
    pass

# Examples:
# da = DataAnalyzer([1, 3, 5, 7])
# print(da.average())  # Expected: 4.0
# print(da.total())    # Expected: 16
# print(da.median())   # Expected: 4.0
