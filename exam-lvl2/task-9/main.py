# Implement a Custom Iterator for Prime Numbers
# Objective: Design a class `PrimeIterator` that generates an infinite sequence of prime numbers.
# Parameters:
# - None, but the iterator should handle internal state for generating primes.
# Returns:
# - Prime numbers, one at a time, indefinitely.
# Details:
# - Implement the iterator protocol methods `__iter__()` and `__next__()`.
# - Use a sophisticated method to check for primes to ensure efficiency as numbers grow large.

class PrimeIterator:
    pass

# Example:
# primes = PrimeIterator()
# for _ in range(10):
#     print(next(primes))  # Prints the first 10 prime numbers
